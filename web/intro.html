    <p>Hi there!</p> 
    
    <p>This page is meant as an introduction to me, myself and I.</p>

    <p>My name is Jelle, 38 years old, living in the Netherlands. In order to not completely dox myself,
    I'll leave out more identifying information about myself. I dislike putting myself out there like 
    that and it's obviously not a good idea if you value your own security.</p>

    <p>I enjoy messing around with programming languages, design and just learning new things.</p>

    <p>I don't involve myself in politics, but I do keep track of it and have my own opinions, but I don't
    don't feel the need to broadcast those opinions to the world.</p>

    <p>Up top you may find links to some of my CV and a page containing a form in order to contact
    me easily </p>
